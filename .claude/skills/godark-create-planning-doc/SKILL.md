# Create Planning Doc

Generate a detailed planning document for a single phase of the project roadmap.
The planning doc expands each issue slug from the roadmap into a full spec with
description, constraints, acceptance criteria, and test cases.

## Steps

1. **Read the roadmap** — Read the phase file from `docs/roadmap/` (or the
   configured `roadmap_path`), e.g. `docs/roadmap/phase-30.md`. If unsure which
   file, read `docs/roadmap/README.md` first to find the phase. Extract the
   phase name, goal, milestone, and issue slugs.

2. **Read prior planning docs** — Read existing files in `docs/planning/` (or
   the configured `planning_dir`) to understand the project's conventions,
   naming patterns, and level of detail.

3. **Read project context** — Read `CLAUDE.md` (if it exists) for architecture
   and coding conventions. Also read
   `docs/architecture.json` and `docs/conventions.md` if they exist to
   understand the current architecture layers and agreed coding conventions.

4. **Explore the change surface** — For each issue slug, before discussing it
   with the user, explore the codebase to understand what the issue would
   actually touch:
   - Search for types, functions, and packages the issue would likely affect
     (grep for relevant symbols from the issue description and roadmap slug).
   - Read the key files to understand their size, complexity, and coupling
     (count lines, note function signatures, check imports and callers).
   - Cross-reference touched files against `docs/architecture.json` to identify
     which layers are involved and whether the change spans layer boundaries.
   - Count: files that would change, approximate lines affected, number of
     callers/importers of code being modified.
   - Present a brief impact summary when discussing each issue with the user:
     "This issue would touch N files across M layers: [list]. The main
     complexity is [X]."
   - Use these concrete numbers — not description-based guesses — to drive the
     task sizing rules.

5. **Discuss each issue** — For each issue slug in the phase, work with the user
   to flesh out:
   - What exactly should be built
   - Key constraints (package paths, function signatures, dependencies)
   - How it relates to / depends on other issues
   - Acceptance criteria (concrete, checkable outcomes)
   - Test cases (named, with inputs and expected outputs)

   Ask clarifying questions. Don't assume — the user knows what they want, and
   vague specs lead to bad agent output.

   When new phases introduce packages that don't fit any existing layer in
   `docs/architecture.json`, prompt the user to update `docs/architecture.json`
   before finalising the spec (or suggest running `/godark-define-architecture`
   to revise the layer definitions).

6. **Write the planning doc** — Create the file in `docs/planning/` using the
   format below. The filename should be `phase-N-<kebab-slug>.md` matching the
   phase name.

7. **Print summary** — List the file path and issue count.

## Format

```markdown
# Phase N: <Phase Name>

> **Goal:** <Phase goal from roadmap>

## Milestone

`<Milestone Name>`

---

## Issue: <Title>

**Blocked by**: #N (if applicable)

### Description

<What to build and why.>

### Key constraints

- <Package path, function signature, or design constraint>

### Acceptance criteria

- [ ] <Concrete, verifiable outcome>
- [ ] <Concrete, verifiable outcome>

### Test cases

- **<Test name>**: <Description of input and expected output>
- **<Test name>**: <Description of input and expected output>

---

## Issue: <Title>
...
```

## Rules

- Every issue must have Description, Acceptance criteria, and Test cases
  sections.
- Acceptance criteria must use `- [ ]` checkbox format.
- Test cases must use `- **Name**: description` format.
- Dependencies use `**Blocked by**: #N` notation (with issue numbers if known,
  or issue titles if numbers haven't been assigned yet).
- Issue headings use `## Issue: <Title>` (not `## Issue N:`) — issue numbers
  are added later by `/godark-create-issues`.
- Do not create GitHub issues — that is handled by `/godark-create-issues`.
- Do not modify the roadmap — that is handled by `/godark-create-milestone`.
- If a planning doc already exists for this phase, ask the user whether to
  replace it or update specific issues.

## Cross-layer moves

When an issue moves, copies, or re-exports code from one architecture layer to
another (e.g., `features → shared`, `app → shared`), the spec must trace the
import chain and resolve every violation **before the issue is written**:

1. **List every import** in the file(s) being moved. For each import, check
   whether it is legal in the destination layer (per `docs/architecture.json`).
2. **For each illegal import**, specify the exact resolution in the Key
   constraints section:
   - Extract the dependency to the destination layer (or a layer it can reach).
   - Add a re-export in the original location so existing callers still compile.
   - Or restructure the dependency in some other explicit way.
3. **Verify constraints are consistent.** If the spec says "don't modify file X"
   but an import resolution requires changing file X, that's a contradiction.
   Resolve it (e.g., use re-exports so file X stays untouched) or split into
   separate issues (one to extract, one to migrate callers).

The goal is to prevent the implementer from having to improvise layer-violation
fixes at implementation time, which causes review/retry fights when the fix
conflicts with other constraints in the same issue.

## Task sizing

Each issue must be small enough for an agent to implement in a single run
(~15 minutes). An issue is too large if any of these apply:

- **More than 5 acceptance criteria** — split into separate deliverables.
- **More than 7 test cases** — this usually means multiple concerns are bundled.
- **Creates new code AND modifies existing code** — split "add new package" from
  "wire it into existing code" from "remove/migrate old code."
- **Touches more than 3 existing files** — use the file count from step 4, not
  a guess from the description. The agent loses context on cross-cutting changes.
- **High fan-out modification** — if a function or type being changed has more
  than 5 callers (found via grep in step 4), split into "change the interface"
  and "update callers" rather than doing both at once.
- **Combines additive and destructive changes** — adding a new system and
  removing the old one should be separate issues so each is independently
  verifiable.
- **Multiple execution modes** — if the description says "in mode X do A, in
  mode Y do B" (e.g., host mode vs sandbox mode, sync vs async), split each
  mode into its own issue. The first mode establishes the interface, subsequent
  modes add variants.
- **Wiring + retry/loop logic** — if an issue both integrates a new subsystem
  AND adds retry/fix/fallback behavior around it, split the basic integration
  (happy path + fail-fast) from the retry loop.

When an issue triggers multiple flags, ask the user whether to split it. Present
the natural seams you see (e.g., "this issue has 9 test cases and two execution
modes — would you like to split host-mode wiring from sandbox-mode?") and let
them decide. Don't auto-split without confirmation.

When an issue is too large, split it along natural boundaries:

1. **New package/module** — pure new code with its own tests, no existing files
   modified.
2. **Integration/wiring** — connect the new code to existing callers. Happy path
   and fail-fast only.
3. **Retry/fix loops** — add retry, fix cycle, or fallback behavior on top of
   the basic wiring.
4. **Variant modes** — add alternative execution paths (sandbox, async, etc.)
   that share the same interface.
5. **Migration/cleanup** — remove old code, update config, rename fields.

Each sub-issue should be independently deployable and testable. Use `Blocked by`
dependencies to enforce ordering.

## Integration chain audit

After all issues are drafted, trace every new type, field, config value, and
function from its **point of origin** to its **point of consumption** to verify
the chain is complete. This catches a recurring failure mode: features are built
to spec at each layer but the glue between layers is missed, so the feature
ships disconnected from the system.

For each new type or field introduced in the phase:

1. **Identify the origin** — where is it defined? (e.g., a new config struct,
   a new field on a result type, a new event enum)
2. **Trace every hop to the consumer** — walk the call chain from the entry
   point (CLI command, route handler, main widget) down to where the new code
   is used. List each intermediate function or constructor that must pass the
   value through
3. **Verify each hop is covered by an issue** — if a shared utility function
   (e.g., an options builder, a widget factory, a route registration helper)
   sits between two issues and neither issue mentions it, that hop will be
   missed at implementation time
4. **If a hop falls between issues**, either:
   - Expand the downstream wiring issue to include the hop explicitly in its
     Key constraints (preferred — keeps issue count down)
   - Add a dedicated "connect X to Y" issue if the hop is non-trivial

Present the chain audit to the user as a table or list before finalizing:

```
FeatureConfig defined in #A (config)
  → read by buildOptions() in #??? ← NOT COVERED
  → passed to runFeature() in #B (integration)
  → used by featureCallback() in #B
```

Any row marked "NOT COVERED" must be resolved before the planning doc is
complete. This is especially important for:
- **Config fields** that must flow from file → config struct → constructor →
  runtime consumer
- **UI components** that must be instantiated and mounted in a parent widget,
  route, or layout
- **New parameters** added to inner functions that must be threaded through
  every caller in the chain
- **Event types** that must be registered with dispatchers, routers, or
  notification systems

## CRITICAL — Next step

When this skill completes, suggest the user run `/godark-create-issues` next.
Do NOT attempt to create GitHub issues yourself — the skill contains specific
formatting, validation, and dependency-ordering directives that must be followed
exactly. The full workflow order is:

1. `/godark-create-milestone`
2. `/godark-create-planning-doc` (this skill)
3. `/godark-create-issues`
4. `/godark-create-scenarios`
